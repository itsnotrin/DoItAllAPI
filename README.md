# DoItAllAPI / DIAA

So. Let's be honest, APIs are a mess. There's so many that do so many different things.
I thought to myself, why don't we just have one that's got everything you need in one place to help cut down on clutter.
That's what I'm hoping this will one day be. The one-stop-shop for anything you need!

# How to use it:

This is designed to be extremely easy to use, either use my 24/7 version (when it's up, put link here) or self host!

## Self Hosting:
1. Git clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/itsnotrin/DoItAllAPI`
2. Install the requirements: `npm install`
3. Start it: `npm run start`

That's it!
